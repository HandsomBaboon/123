3.CPU包括运算器、控制器；还包括若干个寄存器和高速缓冲存储器。
CPU不包括缓存

二级缓存（L2 CACHE）出现是为了协调一级缓存与内存之间的速度，二级缓存比一级缓
存速度更慢，容量更大，主要就是做一级缓存和内存之间数据临时交换的地方用。
二级缓存就是一级缓存的缓冲器：一级缓存制造成本很高因此它的容量有限，二级缓存的
作用就是存储那些CPU处理时需要用到、一级缓存又无法存储的数据。

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a
 computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by
  performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output
   (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer 
   industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since
    the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a 
    processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control
     unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from
      external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.
Random-access memory (RAM ) is a form of computer data storage that 
stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access 
memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the
 same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data 
 inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage
  media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic 
  tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data
   items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on
   the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media 
   rotation speeds and arm movement.
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in
 computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be
 modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used
  to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific 
  hardware,
  and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in 
  plug-in cartridges.
In computer architecture, a bus(a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is 
a communication system that transfers data between components inside a 
computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related 
hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, 
including communication protocols.
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations 
or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.Large 
problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be 
solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel 
computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. 
Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but 
it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints 
preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently 
heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, 
parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer 
architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

把所有计算资源集结起来看成一个整体(一朵云)，通过并发使用资源完成操作请求。每
个操作请求都可以按照一定的规则分割成小片段，分发给不同的机器同时运算，每个机器
其实只要做很小的计算就可以，最后将这些计算结果整合，输出给用户。
