3）IR：指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令 
PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址 
ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为
ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果

前八位称命令指示，第四位为寻址模式，例子中为0，表示操作数是该地址的内容；后八位
称为操作数，表示数值或地址，例子中表示内存中地址1。整个例子表示加上将内存地址1

1)An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any 
low-level programming language in which there is a very strong 
correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's 
machine code instructions.

A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written 
in one programming language (the source language) into another 
programming language (the target language). Compilers are a type of 
translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. The name 
compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from 
a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., 
assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an 
executable program.

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm 
that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same 
way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, 
an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. 
Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
4）
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a 
style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that 
treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and 
avoids changing-state and mutable data
5）
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from 
structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
