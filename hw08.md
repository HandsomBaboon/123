1）A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases 
used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of 
a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a 
reverse engineering fashion. 
2）A work-breakdown structure (WBS) in project management and systems 
engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into 
smaller components.
3）前者是由上到下进行的，而后者是根据不同的种类划分的

set the water in >> soap the clothes >> wash the clothes >> dewatering 
the clothes >> stop the work 
注水 >> 浸泡 >> 洗涤和漂洗 >> 脱水 >> 停机
2）注水： 
turn on the water_in_switch 
set the water volume 
while(water_input is less than the water volume) 
 keep the water_in_switch open 
while(water_input is more than the water volume or volume timeout) 
  stop input water

浸泡 
set the soaping time 
for(set the left time is zero ;the left time is less than the setting time; increase the left time) 
 keep the clothes soaping 
if(the left time is equal to the setting time) 
  begin to wash

洗涤和漂洗 
set the washing times to 3 
set the washing time to 20 
for(set a to zero; a is less than setting times; add 1 to a;) 
  if(the washing times is not the 1st time) 
   pouring the water 
   pouring in the new and clean water 
do 
  washing and motor runs 
while(the pass time is less than the washing time) 
pouring the water

脱水 
set the motor run’s frequency 
set the running time 
while the past time is less than the running time 
 keep the motor running in the setting frequency

1）快速洗衣的时候没有浸泡的过程
2）改进：加快转速

等待指定的时间可以通过上下键调节
注水量的多少可以先设定不同的水位，然后通过上下键控制水位
排水则可以同理注水量通过自动排水，排多少水来定
